🌱 Soil Test Kit Concept Project
📌 Overview

This project presents a concept for a low-cost soil testing kit designed to help farmers and gardeners analyze soil nutrient levels and make better fertilization decisions. The project also includes a basic illustrative financial model to explore the feasibility of the idea.

The goal is to understand how simple agricultural technologies can improve crop productivity and soil management, especially for small-scale farmers.

🌾 Key Insights

Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) are primary nutrients required by most commercial crops.

Soil test kits provide quick and accessible soil health assessments.

Farmers can optimize fertilizer use and improve crop yields using soil data.

Low-cost testing tools can benefit small farmers and developing regions.

💰 Financial Modeling (Conceptual)

This project includes a basic illustrative financial framework to understand:

Estimated production costs

Pricing assumptions

Market potential

Profitability scenarios

⚠️ Note: The financial model is conceptual and intended for academic learning purposes only. It is not a complete business plan.

🛠 Skills & Tools Demonstrated
